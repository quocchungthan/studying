Created a real-time collaboration platform for remote teams facing communication and project management challenges. The tool combined instant messaging, task tracking, and document sharing in a unified interface, enabling teams to stay connected and productive. We leveraged WebSockets to ensure seamless real-time interactions and integrated popular productivity tools to enhance workflow efficiency. The solution significantly improved team coordination, reducing the reliance on multiple disconnected apps.
